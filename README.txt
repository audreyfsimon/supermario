The name of my project is Super Mario, designed after the 1985 Super Mario Bros video game created by Nintendo. The format of the game is extremely similar to Super Mario Bros, however instead of having multiple levels to beat there is one infinite terrain created for the player, and there is an AI mode in which the player is chased by a sophisticated path-finding enemy. The goal of the game is to move the game sprite as far as they can go in the map until they run out of lives. 

To move the Mario around, you must use the left and right arrow keys to move, and the space bar to jump. To move in the smoothest way possible, one should repetitively click on the left/right key. To pause the game, the user should press ‘P’, and to mute the game the user can press ‘M’. Pressing ‘R’ will restart the game. If you forget what any of the keys are, there is an instruction panel in the main menu.

To kill a goomba, you must jump directly on top of them. If you get hit by a goomba (brown mushroom), a chomper (piranha), or the AI (seen at the top left), your character dies and the game is restarted. 

To run the game in an editor, you must have pygame, VScode, and CMU112 Graphics downloaded, along with the graphics and audio provided in the term project folder. The 1.9.6 version of pygame is also provided in the folder.

There are no shortcut commands that exist in my game. 

I hope you enjoy my term project!
